        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven at 400ºF(200ºC) using upper and lower heat. Boil some water in 2 pots. Heat an iron skillet on medium high heat with a bit of oil. Prepare a bowl of water with ice cubes.</li>
            <li>Add everything in a pot, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Char the chicken on a hot iron skillet for 1-2 minutes, on both sides. Then place in the oven on the upper ⅓ rack, for 10-15 minutes or until fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling in a pot, gently add in the eggs and immediately lower the fire. Leave to simmer for 6 ½ minutes and then place the eggs into the ice water bowl. Leave to cool completely before peeling them. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles into another pot of boiling water and cook according to the packet's instructions. Drain the noodles and set aside.</li>
            <li>Discard garlic and ginger from the broth. Slice the shiitake and some spring onion. Slice the chicken in thin slices.</li>
            <li>Ladle some broth into 2 bowls. Add in the noodles, followed by chicken slices and shiitake. Slice the eggs and place in each bowl. Finish off with some sliced spring onion and tuck in a piece of nori sheet on one side of the bowl. Serve immediately!</li>
